# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to enhance both UI and UX of the soutle website given to me as a task. In this repository, I will be providing code snippets and some information on parts of the code I believe would  enhance the UI/UX.

# Installation & Usage
The code snippets provided in this file would be in the form of React components. So for the process of installation, it should be installed the normal way and then imported or copied into where it needs to be implemented.

All suggested improvements are intended for the Soulte landing page.

# 1.Email Section on Mobile View:
First update I had thought about which could generally improve user experience on the Soulte app is an Email modal which holds information that notifies a user about joining the waitlist and has an additional input for the user subscribing to the app's weekly email updates. 

The code mockup could be found in this repository as a component named EmailModal.jsx.

# 2. Video Slider
The section where there are two AI generated videos which are stacked on top of each other are too big for a user to view all the time. For generally improved UI/UX, there should be a video slider which runs automatically and infinitely through that section of the page.

# 3.Additional Nav Links
This is an optional adjustment. Where there are just two nav-links on the navbar which links the user to two different sections on the website, there could be room for more, which directs the user to other sections on the landing page. This will generally improve the UI/UX as a user can confidently navigate to any section of their choice on the landing page.

# 4.Tab View
While this is also optional, I believe it will increase the tablet user experience by 10%. Currently I have noticed that the area displaying AI generated videos would be more interesting as four videos next to each other than 3. the last one will be positioned to the right so they can be aligned in the shape of a cross.

# Credits & Contact
While all initial code is from the website https://soutle.com, I, Esther Chinda would be attempting and providing bits of code that can be used to enhance the overall outlook of the site.
